Battery Temperature Monitor

The battery temperature monitor can restrict charging
behavior according to the temperature threshold.
It use the qpnp-adc-tm driver for threshold notification
and power supply framework interface to control charging
behavior.

Required properties:

 - compatible : should be "battery_tm"
 - qcom,batt-tm-adc-tm = phandle of qpnp-adc-tm
 - qcom,charger = phandle of qpnp-charger
 - tm,low-vreg-mv = reduced battery regulation voltage in mV
 - tm,low-current-ma = reduced battery charging current in mA
 - tm,warm-cfg = array of warm temp threshold, action and health

		< (thr) (next_cool_thr) (next_warm_thr) action  health >

		thr : current temp threshold in 0.1 Celsius degree
		next_cool_thr : next cool threshold in 0.1 Celsius degree
		next_warm_thr : next warm threshold in 0.1 Celsius degree
		action :
			CHG_ENABLE = 0
			CHG_DECREASE = 1
			CHG_STOP = 2
			CHG_SHUTDOWN = 3
		health :
			POWER_SUPPLY_HEALTH_UNKNOWN = 0
			POWER_SUPPLY_HEALTH_GOOD = 1
			POWER_SUPPLY_HEALTH_OVERHEAT = 2
			POWER_SUPPLY_HEALTH_COLD = 7

 - tm,cool-cfg = array of cool temp threshold, action and health

		< (thr) (next_cool_thr) (next_warm_thr) action  health >

		thr : current temp threshold in 0.1 Celsius degree
		next_cool_thr : next cool threshold in 0.1 Celsius degree
		next_warm_thr : next warm threshold in 0.1 Celsius degree
		action :
			CHG_ENABLE = 0
			CHG_DECREASE = 1
			CHG_STOP = 2
			CHG_SHUTDOWN = 3
		health :
			POWER_SUPPLY_HEALTH_UNKNOWN = 0
			POWER_SUPPLY_HEALTH_GOOD = 1
			POWER_SUPPLY_HEALTH_OVERHEAT = 2
			POWER_SUPPLY_HEALTH_COLD = 7

Example:
	battery_tm {
		compatible = "battery_tm";
		status = "ok";
		qcom,batt-tm-adc_tm = <&pm8226_adc_tm>;
		qcom,charger = <&pm8226_chg>;
		tm,low-vreg-mv = <4100>;
		tm,low-current-ma = <200>;
		tm,warm-cfg = <
			 (-50) (-100) (450) 0 1
			 (450)  (430) (550) 1 2
			 (550)  (430) (600) 2 2
			 (600)  (430) (790) 3 2>;
		tm,cool-cfg = <
			(-100) (-300) (-50) 2 7
			 (430) (-100) (450) 0 1>;
	};
